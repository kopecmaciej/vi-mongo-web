# Security

Vi Mongo provides optional password encryption to secure your MongoDB connection credentials stored in the configuration file. This feature helps protect sensitive information even if your configuration files are compromised.

## Encryption Key Setup

### Generating an Encryption Key

For now Vi Mongo can generate a secure encryption key using the `--gen-key` flag:

```bash
vi-mongo --gen-key
```

This command will output a randomly generated 256-bit encryption key in hexadecimal format, along with instructions on how to use it:

```
Encryption key successfully generated for vi-mongo:
a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456

Please store this key securely using one of the following methods:
- Set it as an environment variable: VI_MONGO_SECRET_KEY
- Save it to a file and reference the path in the config file
  or use the CLI option: vi-mongo --key-path=/path/to/key
```

### Using Environment Variable

The most common approach is to set the encryption key as an environment variable.
You have several options for managing this securely:

#### Permanent Setup

For persistent access across all sessions, add the variable to your shell profile:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc
export VI_MONGO_SECRET_KEY="your-generated-key-here"
```

```fish
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish or fish_variables
set -gx VI_MONGO_SECRET_KEY "your-generated-key-here"

```
Then reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc or config.fish
```

Or you can store it in some `.env`, add proper permissions and source it, which can be consider more secure.

#### Session-only Usage

For temporary use without permanent storage, set the variable only when running Vi Mongo:

```bash
VI_MONGO_SECRET_KEY="your-generated-key-here" vi-mongo
```

This approach ensures the key is only available during the application runtime and doesn't persist in your shell history or environment.

### Using Key File

Alternatively, you can store the key in a file and reference it in two ways:

#### Via Command Line Flag

```bash
vi-mongo --key-path=/path/to/your/keyfile
```

#### Via Configuration File

Add the key file path to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
encryptionKeyPath: "/path/to/your/keyfile"
```

The key file should contain only the encryption key (no additional formatting):

```
a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456
```

## How Encryption Works

### With Encryption Key

When an encryption key is available (via environment variable or file):

1. **Adding Connections**: Passwords are automatically encrypted before being stored in the configuration file
2. **Using Connections**: Passwords are decrypted in memory when connecting to MongoDB
3. **Configuration Storage**: Only encrypted passwords are stored in `config.yaml`

### Without Encryption Key

When no encryption key is configured:

1. **Adding Connections**: Passwords are stored in plain text in the configuration file
2. **Using Connections**: Passwords are used directly without decryption
3. **Security Risk**: Credentials are visible to anyone with access to the configuration file

## Security Best Practices

### File Permissions

If using a key file, ensure it has restrictive permissions:

```bash
# Create the key file
echo "your-generated-key-here" > ~/.config/vi-mongo/encryption.key

# Set restrictive permissions (owner read-only)
chmod 600 ~/.config/vi-mongo/encryption.key
```

### Environment Variable Security

When using environment variables:

1. Avoid storing the key in shell history
2. Use secure methods to set the environment variable
3. Consider using a password manager or secrets management system
4. Be cautious when sharing terminal sessions or screenshots

### Key Storage Recommendations

1. **Never commit encryption keys to version control**
2. **Use different keys for different environments** (development, staging, production)
3. **Regularly rotate encryption keys** and update stored connections
4. **Backup your key securely** - losing it means losing access to encrypted connections

## Migration Between Encrypted and Unencrypted

### Adding Encryption to Existing Connections

If you have existing unencrypted connections and want to add encryption:

1. Generate an encryption key: `vi-mongo --gen-key`
2. Set up the key (environment variable or file)
3. Delete and re-add your connections - they will be automatically encrypted

## Connection Compatibility

### Important Compatibility Rules

- **Encrypted connections require the encryption key**: Connections added with encryption enabled cannot be used without the same encryption key
- **Unencrypted connections work without keys**: Connections added without encryption work regardless of encryption key presence
- **Mixed configurations are supported**: You can have both encrypted and unencrypted connections in the same configuration file

### Troubleshooting Encryption Issues

If you encounter authentication failures when connecting:

1. **Verify the encryption key**: Ensure the same key used to encrypt the password is available
2. **Check key format**: Ensure the key file contains only the hexadecimal key with no extra whitespace or formatting
3. **Environment variables**: Verify the `VI_MONGO_SECRET_KEY` environment variable is set correctly in current shell session
4. **Key file permissions**: Ensure Vi Mongo can read the key file (check file permissions)

## Configuration Example

Example `config.yaml` with encryption key path:

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"
encryptionKeyPath: "/home/user/.config/vi-mongo/encryption.key"

connections:
  - name: "production"
    host: "prod.mongodb.com"
    port: 27017
    username: "app_user"
    password: "a1b2c3...encrypted...789xyz"  # This will be encrypted
    database: "myapp"
    
  - name: "local"
    host: "localhost"
    port: 27017
    database: "test"
    # No password = no encryption needed
```
