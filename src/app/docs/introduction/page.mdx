# Introduction

Vi Mongo is a terminal-based UI (TUI) for managing MongoDB databases, built with
Go. Itâ€™s designed for developers, sysadmins, and anyone who prefers working
within the terminal, eliminating the need to switch to external GUIs for routine
database tasks as this is the main goal of this project.
