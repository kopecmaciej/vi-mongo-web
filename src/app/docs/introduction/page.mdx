# Introduction

Vi Mongo is a terminal-based UI (TUI) for managing MongoDB databases, built with
Go. Itâ€™s designed for developers, sysadmins, and anyone who prefers working
within the terminal, eliminating the need to switch to external GUIs for routine
database tasks as this is the main goal of this project.

## Why Use Vi Mongo?
---

Vi Mongo helps you perform essential MongoDB operations quickly and
efficiently without leaving your terminal. Whether you're querying,
browsing collections, or visualizing database stats, Vi Mongo provides a fast,
intuitive experience that complements your terminal-centric workflow.

While comprehensive tools like MongoDB Compass offer a full-featured GUI, Vi
Mongo is focused on streamlining common tasks and reducing the time spent
performing simple operations, making it ideal for day-to-day database
management.

## Key Features:
---

- Intuitive Command Interface: Use vi-like commands to navigate and manage your
  MongoDB databases.
- Simple management: Vi Mongo allows you to manage your database in a simple way
  with a minimalistic approach.
- Open Source: Vi Mongo is open source and free to use, it will be developed
  according to the needs of the users. (if any ;) )
