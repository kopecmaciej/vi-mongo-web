# Usage

After installing Vi Mongo, you can run it by typing `vi-mongo` in your terminal.

```bash
vi-mongo
```
<br />

## Key Shortcuts

In any moment you can press `?` to see the help page with all available shortcuts. Keybindings are mostly inspired by [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), but some of them are costumized for efficiency.

## Resizing Terminal

Resizing the terminal while running Vi Mongo should work fine, as it's based on [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview) library which is fully rezisable, but if you encounter any issues, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/kopecmaciej/vi-mongo/issues).

## Configuration

All configuration files will be stored in the `~/.config/vi-mongo` directory, but it depends on the system settings as the environment variable `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` can be set to different directories. For more information, refer to the [XDG Base Directory](https://github.com/adrg/xdg?tab=readme-ov-file#xdg-base-directory).

### Configuration Files

Vi Mongo uses three main configuration files:

1. `config.yaml`: General application settings
2. `[style].yaml`: UI styling configuration in the `styles` directory
3. `keybindings.json`: Keyboard shortcuts configuration

### Database Visibility Settings

If you're unable to see certain databases or collections, you may need to adjust the authorization settings in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
options:
  authorizedDatabases: false    # Set to false to see all databases
  authorizedCollections: false  # Set to false to see all collections
```

These options control whether Vi Mongo only shows databases and collections that the authenticated user has explicit permissions for. Setting them to `false` will show all available databases and collections, which can be useful for troubleshooting visibility issues.
For more information go to [listCollections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/listCollections/) and [listDatabases](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/listDatabases/)

For detailed configuration instructions, visit the [Configuration Guide](/docs/configuration).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using Vi Mongo feel free to open a new issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kopecmaciej/vi-mongo/issues).

Possible issues:

- Keybindings not working as expected (refer to [Configuration Guide](/docs/configuration))
- Icons missing or not properly displayed - this is very common problem in terminal applications, either change them in the config file or install Nerd Font/Icons
- General performance issues (for very large databases and collections)
- Regex search not working the same as in MongoDB documentation (eg, `/pattern/` will not work as expected, use `{ "$regex": "pattern", "$options": "i" }` instead). Fix listed in the [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap)
- MongoDB types are not yet properly tested so have in mind that some types like `BSONSymbol` or `Code` can be misssing or not displayed properly.
