- **JSON View**: Shows the complete formatted JSON structure
- **Single Line View**: Compact representation of documents

### Document Editing

When editing documents:

1. Changes are made in your default text editor (defined by the `EDITOR` env variable or in config)
2. File is saved in JSON format
3. Document is validated before saving to MongoDB
4. Special MongoDB types like ObjectID, Date, etc. are preserved

### Query Building

The query bar accepts standard MongoDB query syntax:

```json
{ "name": { "$regex": "^John", "$options": "i" } }
```

You can also use the AI Query feature (`Ctrl+A`) to generate queries using natural language.

### Sorting Documents

The sort bar (`s`) accepts MongoDB sort syntax:

```json
{ "age": 1 }
```
You can also quickly sort by a column by pressing `S` when the column is selected.

### Projection

To show specific fields:

```json
{ "name": 1, "surname": 1 }
```
or to hide given field

```json
{ "_id": 0, "name": 0 }
```  
Rember that you cannot combine both `0` and `1` in one projection.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using Vi Mongo feel free to open a new issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kopecmaciej/vi-mongo/issues).

Possible issues:

- Keybindings not working as expected (refer to [Configuration Guide](/docs/configuration))
- Icons missing or not properly displayed - this is very common problem in terminal applications, either change them in the config file or install Nerd Font/Icons
- General performance issues (for very large databases and collections)
- Regex search not working the same as in MongoDB documentation (eg, `/pattern/` will not work as expected, use `{ "$regex": "pattern", "$options": "i" }` instead). Fix listed in the [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap)
- MongoDB types are not yet properly tested so have in mind that some types like `BSONSymbol` or `Code` can be misssing or not displayed properly.

## Resizing Terminal

Resizing the terminal while running Vi Mongo should work fine, as it's based on [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview) library which is fully rezisable, but if you encounter any issues, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/kopecmaciej/vi-mongo/issues).
