# Vi Mongo Configuration Guide

Vi Mongo uses a flexible configuration system that allows you to customize various aspects of the application. This guide will walk you through the different configuration files and how to modify them.

## Configuration Files

Vi Mongo uses three main configuration files:

1. `config.yaml`: General application settings
2. `[style].yaml`: UI styling configuration in `styles` directory
3. `keybindings.json`: Keyboard shortcuts configuration

All configuration files are stored in the `~/.config/vimongo` directory (or the directory specified by the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable).

## General Configuration
---

The `config.yaml` file contains general settings for the application. Here's an overview of the main configuration options:

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"
log:
  path: "/tmp/vi-mongo.log"
  level: "info"
  prettyPrint: true
debug: false
editor:
  command: ""
  env: "EDITOR"
showConnectionPage: true
showWelcomePage: false
currentConnection: ""
currentStyle: default.yaml
connections:
  - name: "Local"
    url: "mongodb://localhost:27017"
    host: "localhost"
    port: 27017
    database: "test"
    username: ""
    password: ""
    timeout: 10
```

### Key Configuration Options:

- `log`: Logging settings (path, level, and pretty printing)
- `debug`: Enable/disable debug mode
- `editor`: External editor settings
- `showConnectionPage`: Show the connection page on startup
- `showWelcomePage`: Show the welcome page on startup
- `currentConnection`: The name of the current active connection
- `currentStyle`: The name of the file containing the current style settings
- `connections`: List of MongoDB connections

To add a new connection, you can either use the UI or manually add an entry to the `connections` list in the `config.yaml` file.

## Styling Configuration
---

The `styles` directory contains available styles that allow you to customize the appearance of Vi Mongo. Each style file is named after the style it represents (e.g., `default.yaml`, `dark-blue.yaml`, etc.).

Here's an example of the structure for a style file:

```yaml
global:
  backgroundColor: "#0F172A"
  textColor: "#E2E8F0"
  secondaryTextColor: "#FDE68A"
  borderColor: "#387D44"
  focusColor: "#4ADE80"
  titleColor: "#387D44"
  graphicsColor: "#387D44"

welcome:
  textColor: "#FDE68A"
  formLabelColor: "#FDE68A"
  formInputColor: "#E2E8F0"
  formInputBackgroundColor: "#1E293B"

# ... (other sections like connector, header, databases, content, etc.)
```

You can customize colors using hex color codes. Make sure to keep the YAML structure intact when modifying the file.

## Keybindings Configuration 
---

The `keybindings.json` file allows you to customize keyboard shortcuts for various actions in Vi Mongo. The file is structured by different sections of the application. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "toggleFullScreenHelp": {
      "runes": ["?"],
      "description": "Toggle full screen help"
    },
    "openConnector": {
      "keys": ["Ctrl+O"],
      "description": "Open connector"
    }
  },
  "main": {
    "toggleFocus": {
      "keys": ["Tab", "Backtab"],
      "description": "Focus next view"
    },
    "focusDatabase": {
      "keys": ["Ctrl+H"],
      "description": "Focus databases"
    }
  },
  // ... (other sections like database, content, queryBar, etc.)
}
```

### Customizing Keybindings:

- `keys`: An array of key combinations (e.g., "Ctrl+H", "Enter")
- `runes`: An array of single characters (e.g., "?", "a")
- `description`: A brief description of the action

### Known Keybinding Issues

When configuring keybindings, be aware of some potential issues:

1. **Ctrl+H**: This key combination is often interpreted as the Backspace2 (Ctrl+backspace) key in terminal environments, For this given case there is special handling in place to make it work as expected. 
For others like **Ctrl+I** there is no special handling in place, so those keybindings won't work as expected.
2. **Terminal Limitations**: Some key combinations might not work as expected due to limitations in certain terminal emulators. If a keybinding doesn't seem to work, try an alternative combination.

If you encounter unexpected behavior with your custom keybindings, consider these potential issues and try alternative key combinations.

## Applying Changes

After modifying any configuration file, you need to restart Vi Mongo for the changes to take effect. The application will automatically load the updated configuration on startup.

## Resetting to Defaults

If you want to reset your configuration to the default settings, you can delete the configuration files from the `~/.config/vimongo` directory. The next time you start Vi Mongo, it will recreate the configuration files with default values.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues after modifying the configuration files, try the following steps:

1. Verify that the YAML/JSON syntax is correct in the modified files.
2. Check the application logs (default location: `/tmp/vi-mongo.log`) for any error messages.
3. Reset to default configuration by deleting the configuration files and restarting the application.

If problems persist, please open an issue on the Vi Mongo GitHub repository with details about your configuration and the encountered problem.
